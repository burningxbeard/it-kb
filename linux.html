                <p><strong>sudo</strong> allows you to run a program as another user such as root.</p>
                <p><strong>sudo</strong> is commonly used to allow admin rights to perform tasks that a standard user cannot such as creating folders or running programs that require root permissions.</p>
                <p><strong>su</strong> switches you to another user typically root.</p> 
                <p>Default file location for the primary configuration file is <strong>/etc/sudoers</strong></p>

                <p>To broadcast a message you can add it on to the shutdown command e.g.: shutdown 13:00 The system is going down for maintenance</p></td>

                <p>The use of the <strong>cat -n</strong> appends each line with a number that would allow easy identification of line 42</p>
                <p>The <strong>head</strong> command by default displays the first ten text lines of a file.</p>
                <p>By default the <strong>tail</strong> command displays the last ten lines of text in a file.</p>
                <p>The <strong>-f</strong> switch allows to monitor a file as new entries are added.<br>

                <p>Which argument used with sort would be used to sort contents of a file in numerical order?</p></td>
                <td class="answer"><h5>Linux - Command Line - split command</h5>
                <p><strong>split</strong> allows you to divide a large file into smaller chunks</p>
                <p><strong>split -l 10 fourty.txt split40</strong>  - This would split the main file into four files with ten lines each in them.</p>
                <p>The files would be named:</p>
                <p>split40aa</p>

                <p>Linux uses a three tiered approach to protecting files and directories<br>
                Can you name these them?</p>
                <p>You issue a "ls -l" command and get the following output:</p>

                <p>
                The three tiers are:
                <ul><li>-Owner: Each file and directory is assigned to a single owner</li>
                <li>-Group: The files and directories are assigned to a single group of users, this group can be assigned specific privileges to the file or directory that differ from the owner privileges.</li>
                <li>-Others: This category is permissions assigned to accounts that are neither the file owner nor the assigned user group.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The file has the following permissions set:</p>
                <p>-First column (Owner) has read write and execute permissions</p>
                <p>-Second Column (Group) has read and write permissions.</p>
                <p>-Third Column (Others) has read only.</p>
                <p>Owner is John, Group is sales</p>
                <p>chown - The command chown, an abbreviation of change owner, is used on Unix and Unix-like operating systems to change the owner of file system files, directories.</p>
                <p><strong>chgrp</strong> - The command <strong>chgrp</strong>, an abbreviation of change group is used to change the group ownership on the file.</p>

                <p>brts - newer high-performance file system. Can perform its own form of RAID as well as Logical Volume Management</p>
                <p>ecrypytfs- Enterprise Cryptographic Filesystem applies a POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) compliant encryption protocol to data before storing it on the device. This provides an additional layer of security for data stored on the device.</p>
                <p>ext3 -supports files up to '2TiB' with a total file system of 16TiB. Supports journaling as well as faster start up and recovery.</p>
                <p>ext4 - Similar to ext3 except it supports the total file system of 1 EiB and utilizes improved performance features. It is also the current version of the original Linux file system.</p>
                <p>reiserFS - Created before ext3fs and commonly used on older systems</p>
                <p>swap - The swap filesystem allows you to create virtual memory for your system using space on your physical disk.</p></td>

                <p>(mount -f fstype device mountpoint)</p>
                <p>*The mkfs program is actually a front end to several individual tools for creating specific file systems</p>
                <p>*Linux creates files named sdx in the /dev directory for SCSI devices. For the second SCSI device , Linux would create the file /dev/sdb</p>
                <p>*/etc/fstab - Is referenced by Linux to determine which devices should be mounted at boot time.</p>
                <p>*No, use the mount command for temporary use of devices, editing the fstab file Is a more long term solution and requires the device to be present at each boot up.</p>
                <p>*if the device referenced has been removed the system will throw a boot error.</p></td>

            <td class="answer"><h5>Linux - Networking</h5>
            <p>DNS - On most Linux operating systems, the DNS servers that the system uses for name resolution are defined in the /etc/resolv.conf file. That file should contain at least one nameserver line. Each nameserver line defines a DNS server. The name servers are prioritized in the order the system finds them in the file</p>
            <p>*The "host" command queries the DNS server to determine the ip addresses assigned to the specified host name.</p>
            <p>*The "dig" command queries the DNS server to determine the ip addresses assigned to the specified host name.</p>
            <p>*The dig command also allows you to specify a different DNS server which is a handy way of determine whether your default DNS server is at fault if a name resolution fails.</p></td>
