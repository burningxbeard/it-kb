                    <p>An Active Directory domain is a collection of objects within a Microsoft Active Directory network.</p>
                    <p>An object can be a single user, a group or it can be a hardware component, such as a computer or printer.</p>
                    <p>Each domain holds a database containing object identity information.</p>
                    <p>The main service in AD is Domain Services (AD DS), which stores directory information and handles the interaction of the user with the domain.</p>
                    <p>AD DS verifies access when a user signs into a device or attempts to connect to a server over a network.</p>
                    <p>Domain Services controls which users have access to each resource.</p></td>

                    <p><strong>Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)</strong></p>
                    <p>* Provides customizable services for issuing and managing digital certificates used that employ public key technologies.</p>
                    <p>* These can be used to encrypt and digitally sign electronic documents and messages.</p>
                    <p>* These digital certificates can be used for authentication of computer, user, or device accounts on a network.</p>
                    <p>* Digital certificates are used to provide:</p>
                    <p>* Confidentiality through encryption</p>
                    <p>* Integrity through digital signatures</p>
                    <p>* Authentication with computers, users, or device accounts within a domain</p>
                    <p><strong>Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)</strong></p>
                    <p>* AD DS stores information about user accounts, such as names, passwords, phone numbers, etc...</p>
                    <p>* It enables authorized users on the same network to access this information.</p>
                    <p>* It stores information about objects on the network</p>
                    <p>* Makes this information easy for administrators and users to find and use.</p>
                    <p>* These objects typically include shared resources such as servers, network shares, printers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)</strong></p>
                    <p>* Enables Federated Identity and Access Management by securely sharing digital identities and entitlements rights.</p>
                    <p>* Extends the ability to use single sign-on functionality within the network to external facing applications.</p>
                    <p><strong>Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)</strong></p>
                    <p>* Is a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory service that provides support for directory enabled applications</p>
                    <p>* Does not need the dependencies and domain restrictions of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Server.</p>
                    <p><strong>Active Directory Rights Management Services (AD RMS)</strong></p>
                    <p>* AD RMS allows users and admins via Information Rights Management (IRM) policies to specify access permissions to documents.</p>
                    <p>* This prevents sensitive information from being accessed, printed, forwarded or copied by unauthorized users.</p>
                    <p>* Permission for a file are enforced no matter where the information is held, as the permission for the file is within the document.</p></td>

                    <p>This is especially useful to remote workers and laptop users that may spend time away from the network, but still need access to there device.</p>

                <p><strong>Distributed File System (DFS)</strong> is used to organize many file shares into a distributed file system.</p>
                <p>DFS has two components to its service: Location transparency (via the namespace component) and Redundancy (via the file replication component).</p>
                <p>Together, these components improve data availability in the case of failure or heavy load by allowing shares in the same or multiple different locations to be logically grouped under one folder, the "DFS root". This makes it possible to give users a virtual view of shared folders, where a single path leads to files located on multiple servers.</p></td>

                    <p>A folder target is the Universal Naming Convention (UNC) path of a shared folder or another namespace that is associated with a folder in a namespace.</p>
                    <p>Yes, there can be multiple folder targets can be associated the folder target and with these additional folder targets, it increases its availability in case of failure of one or more UNC paths and also can provide access to the nearest path based upon the Active Directory Site.</p>
                    <p>A user who browses to, i.e. \domain-name\Public\Documents is transparently redirected to the shared folder, i.e. \SITE01-SVR-01\Documents or, i.e. \SITE02-SVR-02\Documents, depending on which site the user is currently located in.</p></td>
