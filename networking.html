<h5>OSI Model (Layers and Protocols</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>7 - Application layer.  Applications like FTP, web browsers, DNS, SNMP etc live here.  Network services are requested here to be translated downstream over a network.</li>
                    <li>6 - Presentation layer.  Data representation and code formatting to ensure common format is used for sender and receiver to understand. Provides translation of data between the application and network layer. Can include protocols such as SSL/TLS for encryption.</li>
                    <li>5 - Session layer.  Establishes and manages the connections between networked computers/devices. For example, this layer is responsible for closing a session handled by TCP.</li>
                    <li>4 - Transport layer. Ensures reliable transmission of data segments.  Assembly/disassembly of data (segmentation/desegmentation), error control and flow control to control link reliability. TCP, UDP are protocols at this layer.</li>
                    <li>3 - Networking.  This is where routing takes place between different networks - each network has an address and this describes the process of routing packets from one node to another. Routing protocols, BGP, OSPF, RIP etc.  Structure, logical addressing implemented here. NAT, HSRP, ICMP handled here.</li>
                    <li>2 - Data Link layer.  Node-to-node data transfer. MAC (Media Access Control) and LLC (Logical Link Control) for Ethernet, Wi-Fi, ZigBee. Also PPP (Point-to-point protocol).  Flow control and data transmission reliability is defined here as well (CRC added to the frame). Switches work on this layer. ARP at this layer.</li>
                    <li>1 - Physical layer. This is where the physical and electrical specifications are defined. Responsible for conversion of digital data into optical/electrical signals. Also include specification of pin layout, signal timing cable specs etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Importance</h5>
                <p>It's a good network troubleshooting tool</p>
                <p>It establishes a guideline between vendors creating products that perform data communications to ensure interoperability.</p>
                
                <h5>Network Troubleshooting</h5>
                <p>Talk sensibly about how they would troubleshoot network issues, ideally based upon examples. I.E. "First I would check to ensure there were no cable faults....." and so on. Talking about encapsulation etc at this point is positive. Trying to get a feel for their thought processes in this area.</p>

                <p>Talk me through a <strong>network switch</strong> and its functionality.</p></td>
            <td class="answer"><h5>Network Switch</h5>
                <p>Working at OSI Model layer 2 and sometimes layer 3 (When performing routing duties).</p>
                <p>A device that filters and forwards frames between LAN segments. Separate collision domain for each port - i.e. each port can transfer data  without interference/collisions. *Collision domain*</p>
                <p>Multiple VLAN's can be configured on a switch - separate broadcast domains per VLAN. Without VLAN configured a single broadcast domain.</p>
                <p>Switches can be interconnected via a crossover cable. Often switches have RJ45 ports but also SFP ports allowing different media to be used. Layer 3 specific features of a switch allow it to work like a router, Inter-VLAN routing and also routing protocols - depending on the switch or license.</p></td>

            <td class="ask"><h5>Network Fundamentals 006</h5>
                <p>Talk me through a <strong>wireless controller</strong> and access point functionality.</p></td>
            <td class="answer"><h5>Wireless Controller & Access Points</h5>
                <p>A WLAN controller configures and manages light weight access points via the Lightweight Access Point Protocol (LWAPP). These points allow wireless devices to connect to the network, used widely in building where a large area needs to be covered by the same wireless network allowing seamless client connectivity around the building.</p>
                <p>Access points can be used in a standalone configuration. WLC can be cloud based or physical device. Multiple WLC's can be used in a mobility group.</p></td>

                <h5>Transmission Control Protocol &amp; User Datagram Protocol</h5>
                <p>Both operate at the Transport layer, OSI layer 4.</p>
                
                <h5>TCP</h5>
                <p>Protocols: FTP, SSH, Telnet, HTTP, SSH, RDP, DNS can use TCP</p>
                <p>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a connection oriented protocol while  oriented protocol. TCP establishes, maintains and segments a connection between two devices. Connection established via three way handshake SYN --> SYN-ACK --> ACK. Connection closed by FIN (Initiator) --> ACK (Receiver) --> FIN (Receiver) --> ACK(Initiator). Reliable as data resent if packets dropped, also sequences packets.</p>
                
                <h5>UDP</h5>
                <p>Protocols: TFTP, SNMP, DNS by default, NTP, RIP, OSPF
                User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol. UDP broadcasts data without no reliability of transmission. Checksum for data integrity. Used where error checking/correction is not required"</p></td>

                <p>Describe the term 'VLAN' and how this would be deployed in an enterprise network. Include overview of protocols and configuration.</p></td>
            <td class="answer"><h5>VLAN on Enterprise Network</h5>
                <p>VLAN = Virtual Local Area Network</p>
                <p>Understand VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol), trunk links, routing between VLANs.</p> 
                
                <h5>VLAN</h5>
                <p>It is any broadcast domain that is partitioned and isolated in a computer network at the data link layer (OSI layer 2). VLAN can be present over multiple switches (in different locations) in a network but still act like they are on the same LAN.</p>
                
                <h5>Trunk Links</h5>
                <p>IEEE 802.1Q or dot1q, networking standard defining VLAN tagging of ethernet frames. Used to allow multiple vlans to transit an interface to anther switch or router. Can prune vlans down particular trunks - switchport trunk allowed vlan {list}. Native VLAN is untagged, default vlan 1 but can be changed.</p>
                
                <h5>VTP - VLAN Trunking Protocol</h5>
                <p>VLAN Trunking Protocol. Cisco proprietary, Used to synchronize (add, delete, rename) VLANs across a layer 2 network. VTP Server where VLANs can be modified/created/deleted. VTP client synchronizes and forwards advertisements. A device in VTP transparent forwards advertisements only, VLANs are local. Each change increments revision number, need to make sure vlan database is clear when adding used switch to network to avoid higher revision number overwriting existing network with its stale configuration.</p> 
                
                <h5>VLAN Routing</h5>
                <p>Options include multiple routers with vlans on different interfaces, router with sub interfaces, L3 switch.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Configure VLAN on access interface to router. Define IP address on router for gateway.</li>
                    <li>Have a single router and define a sub-interface for each VLAN. On the router Gi0/1.200 for VLAN 200 for example. Enable dot1q encapsulation for the right vlan number. Define IP address. On switch define trunk with dot1q encapsulation.</li>
                    <li>L3 switch define a vlan interface on the switch with the IP address. Term for the interface is SVI = Switched Virtual Interface.</li>

                <p>What is ARP?</p></td>
            <td class="answer"><h5>Address Resolution Protocol</h5>
                <p>ARP is used to map MAC addresses (Data link - layer 2) to IP addresses (Network - layer 3)</p>
                <p>ARP tables used on devices help devices forward traffic to the correct L2 address.</p>
                <p>Proxy ARP is the name given when a node responds to an arp request on behalf of another node. This is commonly used to redirect traffic sent to one IP address to another system. Use of proxy arp could be a security vulnerability.</p></td>

                <p>What other options does DHCP offer?</p></td>
                <td class="answer"><h5>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</h5>
                <p>DHCP allows for the dynamic assignment of IP addresses so that devices can talk to other networks. Without DHCP server either static IP configuration is needed or self assigned APIPA (wont be able to talk outside of subnet).</p>
                
                <p>DHCP can be configured on standalone servers (dhcpd, dnsmasq, dibbler, Windows Servers etc). Can also be configured on networking devices such as Routers.</p>
                
                <p>UDP port number 67 is the destination port of a server, and UDP port number 68 is used by the client. DHCP Discover(Client) >> DHCP Offer(Server) >> DHCP REQUEST(Client) >> DHCP ACK(Server) >> probe for address (client) >> finalize lease(client).</p>
                <p>DHCP offer includes subnet/gateway/dns server/dhcp server ip's/lease time etc. Client address probe ensures no duplicate IP's on subnet from multiple DHCP servers.

                Blocking
                The state of a port when not designated or root port. No frames forwarded. Default is 20secs when an interface needs to move away from blocking.
                Listening
                Only a root or designated port will move to the listening state. The non-designated port will stay in the blocking state. No data transmission occurs at this state for 15 seconds just to make sure the topology doesn’t change in the meantime.

                <p>When a router advertises a destination network as unavailable and then available again in quick sequence.  This can cause routing updates.  BGP has a mechanism called route flap dampening that helps mitigate issues caused by a flapping interface.</p>
                <p>Yes, since this is a directly connected network.</p>

                <td class="answer"><h5>Asymmetrical Routing</h5>
                <p>Asymmetric routing occurs when traffic takes one route to the destination and is returned to the source via a different route. Not always an issue however if there are firewalls in this path connection state information is stored.</p>
                <p>Traffic is prevented from flowing from a lower to higher security domain on the other firewall as it has no state information present. Issues with NAT also.</p>
